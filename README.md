   1. Background
      In today's fast-paced world, it's critical to stay informed about global events. With the advent of technology, accessing news has become easier than ever. Telegram, a popular messaging platform, provides a convenient platform for users to stay updated on the latest news. Developing a Telegram bot capable of delivering news based on user requests leverages this technology to enhance the user experience and accessibility to information.

   2. Problem Statement (from article)
      The problem stems from differing news consumption habits across age groups. Older individuals prefer traditional sources such as websites, while younger generations, especially social media users, favor platforms with social features (Geers, 2020). This highlights the necessity of addressing the gap between traditional and online news consumption patterns. Additionally, false news spreads rapidly on social media due to users sharing information without verifying its accuracy (Pennycook et al., 2021). This underscores the necessity of developing a news Telegram bot that promotes informed sharing by providing reliable and verified news sources to combat misinformation.
