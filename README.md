## Abstract (in 300 words)
   1. Background<br />
In today's fast-paced world, it's crucial to stay informed about global events. With the advent of technology, accessing news has become easier than ever. Telegram, a popular messaging platform, provides a convenient platform for users to stay updated on the latest news. Developing a Telegram bot capable of delivering news based on user requests leverages this technology to enhance the user experience and accessibility to information.

   2. Problem Statement (from article)<br />
      The problem stems from differing news consumption habits across age groups. Older individuals prefer traditional sources such as websites, while younger generations, especially social media users, favor platforms with social features (Geers, 2020). This highlights the necessity of addressing the gap between traditional and online news consumption patterns. Additionally, false news spreads rapidly on social media due to users sharing information without verifying its accuracy (Pennycook et al., 2021). This underscores the necessity of developing a news Telegram bot that promotes informed sharing by providing reliable and verified news sources to combat misinformation.

   3. Main objective<br />
      To develop a Telegram bot that simplifies global news access, bridging traditional and online consumption patterns. Furthermore, to combat misinformation by delivering reliable news from trustworthy sources.

   4. Methodology<br />
      Conducting thorough research on news to understand user preferences and behaviors. Utilizing programming languages such as Java to develop the Telegram bot. Integrating news APIs, such as the GNews API, to fetch reliable and verified news articles from various sources. Additionally, documenting the code extensively using Javadoc comments will ensure clarity and ease of understanding for future maintenance and development purposes.
      
   5. Result<br />
      Upon successful implementation, users will be able to interact with the Telegram bot to receive news updates tailored to their preferences. They can effortlessly retrieve top headlines, search for news by selecting a country, or search for news based on specific keywords, all within the familiar Telegram environment.
      
   6. Conclusion<br />
      Developing a Telegram bot for accessing global news addresses the need for a convenient and efficient solution to stay informed in the current digital era. Through the utilization of Telegram's features and integration with reliable news sources,this project aims to provide users with a seamless experience to access timely and relevant news content.
